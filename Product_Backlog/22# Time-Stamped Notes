As a virtual reality researcher, I should be able to take notes with automated timestamps 
on the videos so I can take notes of relevant information.

Background: 
Ideally I'd like to be able to set a flag (or something similar in the video) 
at the various times where something note worthy happens and then have a way 
to view the associated comments.  I'd also like to be able to see all of the 
comments, with their timestamps and other details, for a particular video in the one view.
