As Head Researcher, I need a mandatory consent form to be completed before participants complete the 
questionnaire so that they are fully informed of what is expected of them. #1
Labels: Deliver Last (Low Risk/Low Value)
Moscow: Should
Story Points: 2
Sub-Tasks:

- [ ] create a page with the consent stuff and confirm button
- [ ] It then redirect to the questionnaire if button pressed (maybe can be done for bootstrap or java).
